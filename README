NAME
    EWS::Client - Microsoft Exchange Web Services Client

VERSION
    version 1.103620

SYNOPSIS
    Set up your Exchange Web Services client. *You will need HTTP Basic
    Access Auth enabled on the Exchange server to use this module*:

     use EWS::Client;
     use DateTime;
     
 my $ews = EWS::Client->new({
         server      => 'exchangeserver.example.com',
         username    => 'oliver',
         password    => 's3krit', # or set in $ENV{EWS_PASS}
     });

    Then perform operations on the Exchange server:

     my $entries = $ews->calendar->retrieve({
         start => DateTime->now(),
         end   => DateTime->now->add( months => 1 ),
     });
     
 print "I retrieved ". $entries->count ." items\n";
     
 while ($entries->has_next) {
         print $entries->next->Subject, "\n";
     }
     
 my $contacts = $ews->contacts->retrieve;

DESCRIPTION
    This module acts as a client to the Microsoft Exchange Web Services API.
    From here you can access calendar and contact entries in a nicely
    abstracted fashion. Query results are generally available in an iterator
    and convenience methods exist to access the properties of each entry.

METHODS
  EWS::Client->new( \%arguments )
    Instantiates a new EWS client. There won't be any connection to the
    server until you call one of the calendar or contacts retrieval methods.

    "server" => Fully Qualified Domain Name (required)
        The host name of the Exchange server to which the module should
        connect.

    "username" => String (required)
        The account username under which the module will connect to
        Exchange. This value will be URI encoded by the module.

    "password" => String OR via $ENV{EWS_PASS} (required)
        The password of the account under which the module will connect to
        Exchange. This value will be URI encoded by the module. You can also
        provide the password via the "EWS_PASS" environment variable.

    "use_negotiated_auth" => True or False value
        The module will assume you wish to use HTTP Basic Access Auth, in
        which case you should enable that in your Exchange server. However
        for negotiated methods such as NTLM set this to a True value. For
        NTLM please also install the LWP::Authen::Ntlm module.

    "schema_path" => String (optional)
        A folder on your file system which contains the WSDL and two further
        Schema files (messages, and types) which describe the Exchange 2007
        Web Services SOAP API. They are shipped with this module so your
        providing this is optional.

    "server_version" => String (optional)
        In each request to the server is specified the API version we expect
        to use. By default this is set to "Exchange2007_SP1" but you have
        the opportunity to set it to "Exchange2007" if you wish using this
        option.

  $ews->calendar()
    Retrieves the EWS::Client::Calendar object which allows search and
    retrieval of calendar entries and their various properties. See that
    linked manual page for more details.

  $ews->contacts()
    Retrieves the EWS::Client::Contacts object which allows retrieval of
    contact entries and their telephone numbers. See that linked manual page
    for more details.
